# cite

A static site generator in ANSI C.

Inspired by using Hugo and seeing [100r's
website][100r]. Written from scratch, just
for the fun of it!

[100r]: https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co 

## Use

Edit `config.h` so it matches your environment, then rebuild with 

```
$ make clean cite
```

cite works well in a build script with a tool like markdown or Pandoc.
